Contributing
============

It's good to hear that you want to contribute to Pony!

First of all please [search existing issues][complete-issue-list]. Apart from bug reports you will
find feature requests and work currently in progress too. If you cannot find a suitable issue â€”
[create a new one][new-issue]. Potential pull requests are no exception. Before you start working,
let's have a discussion and agree on the solution and scope.

Each of [bug report](#bug-report), [feature request](#feature-request) or [pull request](#pull-request)
has to cover different aspects described below.

Bug report
----------
Provide the following details:

  - short summary of what you was trying to achieve,
  - a code causing the bug,
  - expected result,
  - actual results and
  - environment details: at least operating system and compiler version (`ponyc -v`).

If possible, try to isolate the problem and provide just enough code to demonstrate it. Add any
related information which might help to fix the issue.

Feature request
---------------
Define a context and a problem the feature solves. List potential use cases and give some code
examples.

Pull request
------------
Provide the same information as you would for a [feature request](#feature-request). Also briefly
describe what the implementation might look like.
