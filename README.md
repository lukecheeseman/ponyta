# Getting help

Need help? Not to worry, we have you covered.

We have a couple resources designed to help you learn, we suggest starting with
the tutorial and from there, moving on to the Pony Patterns book. Additionally,
standard library documentation is available online.

* [Tutorial](http://tutorial.ponylang.org).
* [Pony Patterns](http://patterns.ponylang.org) cookbook is in progress
* [Standard library docs](http://ponylang.github.io/ponyc/).

If you are looking for an answer "right now", we suggest you give our IRC channel a try. It's #ponylang on Freenode. If you ask a question, be sure to hang around until you get an answer. If you don't get one, or IRC isn't your thing, we have a friendly mailing list you can try. Whatever your question is, it isn't dumb, and we won't get annoyed.

* [Mailing list](mailto:pony+user@groups.io).
* [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ponylang).

Think you've found a bug? Check your understanding first by writing the mailing list. Once you know it's a bug, open an issue.

# Installation

## Using Docker

Want to use the latest revision of Pony source, but don't want to build from source yourself? You can run the `ponylang/ponyc` Docker container, which is created from an automated build at each commit to master.

You'll need to install Docker using [the instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). Then you can pull the latest `ponylang/ponyc` image using this command:

```bash
docker pull ponylang/ponyc:latest
```

Then you'll be able to run `ponyc` to compile a Pony program in a given directory, running a command like this:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/my-code:/src/main ponylang/ponyc
```

If you're unfamiliar with Docker, remember to ensure that whatever path you provide for `/path/to/my-code` is a full path name and not a relative path, and also note the lack of a closing slash, `/`, at the *end* of the path name.

Note that if your host doesn't match the docker container, you'll probably have to run the resulting program inside the docker container as well, using a command like this:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/my-code:/src/main ponylang/ponyc ./main
```

If you're using `docker-machine` instead of native docker, make sure you aren't using [an incompatible version of Virtualbox](#virtualbox).


## Linux using an RPM package (via Bintray)

For Red Hat, CentOS, or Fedora Linux, the `master` and `release` branches are packaged and availabe on Bintray ([pony-language/ponyc-rpm](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-rpm)).

To install  release builds via Yum:
```bash
wget https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-rpm/rpm -O bintray-pony-language-ponyc-rpm.repo
sudo mv bintray-pony-language-ponyc-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/

sudo yum install ponyc-release
```

Or, for master builds:
```bash
yum install ponyc-master
```


## Linux using a DEB package (via Bintray)

For Ubuntu or Debian Linux, the `master` and `release` branches are packaged and availabe on Bintray ([pony-language/ponyc-debian](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-debian)).

To install release builds via Apt:
```bash
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-debian pony-language main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

sudo apt-get install ponyc-release
```

Or, for master builds:
```
sudo apt-get install ponyc-master
```


## Windows using ZIP (via Bintray)

For Windows, the `master` and `release` branches are packaged and availabe on Bintray ([pony-language/ponyc-win](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-win)):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://dl.bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-win/ponyc-VERSION.zip -UseBasicParsing -OutFile ponyc-VERSION.zip
7z x .\ponyc-VERSION.zip
.\ponyc-VERSION\ponyc\bin\ponyc.exe --version
```


## Mac OS X using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

The homebrew version is currently woefully out of date. We are transitioning to
a new release system that will keep homebrew up to date. For now, please build
from source.

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install ponyc
```

## Arch Linux

```bash
pacman -S ponyc
```

## Gentoo Linux

```bash
layman -a stefantalpalaru
emerge dev-lang/pony
```

A live ebuild is also available in the
[overlay](https://github.com/stefantalpalaru/gentoo-overlay)
(dev-lang/pony-9999) and for Vim users there's app-vim/pony-syntax.



# Building ponyc from source

Pony requires LLVM 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8. Please note that **LLVM 3.7.0 does not work**. If you are using LLVM 3.7.x, you need to use 3.7.1. If you are using LLVM 3.6.x, make sure to use 3.6.2.

## Building on Linux
[![Linux and OS X](https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc)

### Arch

```
pacman -S llvm make ncurses openssl pcre2 zlib
```

To build ponyc and compile helloworld:

```bash
$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

### Debian Jessie

Add the following to `/etc/apt/sources`:

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie-3.8 main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie-3.8 main
```

Install the LLVM toolchain public GPG key, update `apt` and install packages:

```bash
$ wget -O - http://llvm.org/apt/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install make gcc g++ git zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev \
                       libssl-dev llvm-3.8-dev
```

Debian Jessie and some other Linux distributions don't include pcre2 in their package manager. pcre2 is used by the Pony regex package. To download and build pcre2 from source:

```bash
$ wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ cd pcre2-10.21
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To build ponyc and compile helloworld:

```bash
$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

### Ubuntu (14.04, 15.10, 16.04)

You should install prebuilt Clang 3.8 from the [LLVM download page](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.8.0) under Pre-Built Binaries:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev llvm-dev
```

Ubuntu and some other Linux distributions don't include pcre2 in their package manager. pcre2 is used by the Pony regex package. To download and build pcre2 from source:

```bash
$ wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ cd pcre2-10.21
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To build ponyc and compile helloworld:

```bash
$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

### Other Linux distributions

You need to have the development versions of the following installed:

* LLVM 3.6.x, 3.7.1, 3.8.x. _LLVM 3.7.0* isn't supported_
* zlib
* ncurses
* pcre2
* libssl

If your distribution doesn't have a package for prce2, you will need to download and build it from source:

```bash
$ wget ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf pcre2-10.21.tar.bz2
$ cd pcre2-10.21
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Finally to build ponyc and compile the hello world app:

```bash
$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

## Building on FreeBSD

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo pkg install gmake
sudo pkg install llvm38
sudo pkg install pcre2
sudo pkg install libunwind
```

This will build ponyc and compile helloworld:

```bash
$ gmake config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

Please note that on 32-bit X86, using LLVM 3.7 or 3.8 on FreeBSD currently produces executables that don't run. Please use LLVM 3.6. 64-bit X86 does not have this problem, and works fine with LLVM 3.7 and 3.8.

## Building on Mac OS X
[![Linux and OS X](https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc)

You'll need llvm 3.6.2, 3.7.1, or 3.8 and the pcre2 library to build Pony.

Either install them via [homebrew](http://brew.sh):
```
$ brew update
$ brew install homebrew/versions/llvm38 pcre2 libressl
```

Or install them via macport:
```
$ sudo port install llvm-3.8 pcre2 libressl
$ sudo port select --set llvm mp-llvm-3.8
```

Then launch the build with Make:
```
$ make config=release
$ ./build/release/ponyc examples/helloworld
```

## Building on Windows
[![Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kckam0f1a1o0ly2j?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sylvanc/ponyc)

_Note: it may also be possible (as tested on build 14372.0 of Windows 10) to build Pony using the [Ubuntu 14.04](#ubuntu-1404-1510-1604) instructions inside [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)._

The LLVM prebuilt binaries for Windows do NOT include the LLVM development tools and libraries. Instead, you will have to build and install LLVM 3.7 or 3.8 from source. You will need to make sure that the path to LLVM/bin (location of llvm-config) is in your PATH variable.

LLVM recommends using the GnuWin32 unix tools; your mileage may vary using MSYS or Cygwin.

- Install GnuWin32 using the [GetGnuWin32](http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) tool.
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/) (3.5 or 2.7).
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
- Get the LLVM source (e.g. 3.7.1 is at [3.7.1](http://llvm.org/releases/3.7.1/llvm-3.7.1.src.tar.xz)).
- Make sure you have VS2015 with the C++ tools installed.
- Generate LLVM VS2015 configuration with CMake. You can use the GUI to configure and generate the VS projects; make sure you use the 64-bit generator (**Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64**), and set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to where you want LLVM to live.
- Open the LLVM.sln in Visual Studio 2015 and build the INSTALL project in the LLVM solution in Release mode.

Building Pony requires [Premake 5](https://premake.github.io).

- Get the [PreMake 5](https://premake.github.io/download.html#v5) executable.
- Get the [PonyC source](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc).
- Run `premake5.exe --with-tests --to=..\vs vs2015` to generate the PonyC
  solution.
- Build ponyc.sln in Release mode.

In order to run the pony compiler, you'll need a few libraries in your environment (pcre2, libssl, libcrypto).

There is a third-party utility that will get the libraries and set up your environment:

- Install [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1514-x64.exe), make sure it's in your PATH.
- Open a **VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt** (things will not work correctly otherwise!) and run:

```
> git clone git@github.com:kulibali/ponyc-windows-libs.git
> cd ponyc-windows-libs
> .\getlibs.bat
> .\setenv.bat
```

Now you can run the pony compiler and tests:

```
> cd path_to_pony_source
> build\release\testc.exe
> build\release\testrt.exe
> build\release\ponyc.exe -d -s packages\stdlib
> .\stdlib
```

## Building with link-time optimisation (LTO)

You can enable LTO when building the compiler in release mode. There are slight differences between platforms so you'll need to do a manual setup. LTO is enabled by setting `lto` to `yes` in the build command line:

```bash
$ make config=release lto=yes
```

If the build fails, you have to specify the LTO plugin for your compiler in the `LTO_PLUGIN` variable. For example:

```bash
$ make config=release LTO_PLUGIN=/usr/lib/LLVMgold.so
```

Refer to your compiler documentation for the plugin to use in your case.

LTO is enabled by default on OSX.


## VirtualBox

Pony binaries can trigger illegal instruction errors under VirtualBox 4.x, for at least the x86_64 platform and possibly others.

Use VirtualBox 5.x to avoid possible problems.

## Building Pony on Non-x86 platforms

On ARM and MIPS platforms, the default gcc architecture specification used in the Makefile of _native_ does not work correctly, and can even result in the gcc compiler crashing.  You will have to override the compiler architecture specification on the _make_ command line.  For example, on a RaspberryPi2 you would say:
```bash
$ make arch=armv7
```
To get a complete list of acceptable architecture names, use the gcc command:
```bash
gcc -march=none
```
This will result in an error message plus a listing off all architecture types acceptable on your platform.
