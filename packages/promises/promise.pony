## Promises Package

A `Promise` represents a value that will be available at a later
time. `Promise`s can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected. Any
number of function handlers can be added to the `Promise`, to be
called when the `Promise` is fulfilled or rejected. These handlers
themselves are also wrapped in `Promise`s so that they can be chained
together in order for the fulfilled value of one `Promise` to be used
to compute a value which will be used to fulfill the next `Promise` in
the chain, or so that if the `Promise` is rejected then the subsequent
reject functions will also be called. The input and output types of a
fulfill handler do not have to be the same, so a chain of fulfill
handlers can transform the original value into something new.

Fulfill and reject handlers can either be specified as classes that
implment the `Fulfill` and `Reject` interfaces, or as functions with
the same signatures as the `apply` methods in `Fulfill` and `Reject`.

In the following code, the fulfillment of the `Promise` causes the
execution of several fulfillment functions. The output is:

```
fulfilled + foo
fulfilled + bar
fulfilled + baz
```

```
use "promises"

class PrintFulfill is Fulfill[String, String]
  let _env: Env
  let _msg: String
  new create(env: Env, msg: String) =>
    _env = env
    _msg = msg
  fun apply(s: String): String =>
    _env.out.print(" + ".join([s, _msg]))
    s

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
     let promise = Promise[String]
     promise.next[String](recover PrintFulfill(env, "foo") end)
     promise.next[String](recover PrintFulfill(env, "bar") end)
     promise.next[String](recover PrintFulfill(env, "baz") end)
     promise("fulfilled")
```

In the following code, the fulfill functions are chained together so
that the fulfilled value of the first one is used to generate a value
which fulfills the second one, which in turn is used to compute a
value which fulfills the third one, which in turn is used to compute a
value which fulfills the fourth one. The output is the average length
of the words passed on the command line or `0` if there are no command
line arguments.
