/** Passes

The passes are split into 3 groups:

1. Module passes.

Run on every Pony source file when it is loaded, regardless of what pass any
other part of the AST is in.
Not run on ASTs built directly via the BUILD macros.

2. AST passes.

Run on all ASTs whether made from source files or generated by the compiler.

In general the sugar pass is run for each file after the module passes and the
other passes are then run for the whole program together. However, when a new
sub-AST is created, eg by sugar, we go back and apply passes to that sub-AST
until it has caught up with the rest of the AST. It is then treated as part of
the overall AST for the remaining passes.

Note that this process of going back and catching up passes for a sub-AST may
happen recursively. For example, during the expr pass a new anonymous class $1
may be created. We go back to catch that up and in it's sugar pass it creates
another new anonymous class $2. Now we catch up $2 to the main tree (expr pass)
and then finish catching up $1.

3. Generate passes.

Run on the whole program AST at once.


* Parse pass (module)

Turns a source file in an AST. Deliberately allows some illegal syntax to
enable better error reporting.

Expects Pony source file or string.

Various AST flags are used to pass information to the syntax pass.


* Syntax pass (module)

Checks for specific illegal syntax cases that the BNF allows. This allows for
better error reporting. If this pass succeeds then the AST is fully
syntactically correct.

Does not change the AST.


* Sugar pass (AST)

Expands the AST to put in the code we've let the programmer miss out. This
includes default capabilities, method return values and else blocks. There are
also some code rewrites, such as assignment to update call and for loop to
while loop.

Not all sugar is perform here since some requires type check information which
is not yet available.

Substantially rewrites the AST.


* Scope pass (AST)

Creates entries in the relevant symbol tables for types, fields, methods,
locals, etc including initialising symbol definition status.

Also handles use commands, including loading other packages. Aliased used
commands are fully handled immediately. For use commands without aliases, the
used package is loaded but the resulting definitions are not merged into the
using package until the import pass.

Other than use commands, does not change the AST itself, only its symbol table
entries.


* Import pass (AST)

Imports symbols from packages "used" without an alias. This can't be done in
the scope pass due to complications from handling circular dependencies between
packages.

Does not change the AST itself, only module symbol table entries.


* Name resolution pass (AST)

TODO


* Flatten pass (AST)

TODO


* Traits pass (AST)

Adds methods inherited by entities from traits and interfaces, including
handling default bodies. Only chnages AST by adding methods to types and bodies
to previously bodiless methods.

Uses the data field of various AST nodes:
* For entities, as a marker to spot dependency loops.
* For methods, internally for storing a data block. At the end of pass points
  to the entity that provided the method body used, NULL if method has no body.
* For method bodies and error indicators, points to an entity providing an
  ambiguous default body.

Also performs minor anomalous tasks that have to be done before the type check
pass.


* Documentation generation pass (AST)

Auto-generates documentation, if the relevant command line flag is given,
otherwise does nothing.

Does not alter the AST at all.


* Expression type check pass (AST)

TODO


* Finaliser pass (AST)

Checks that any finalisers do not perfrom any restricted operations, such as
creating actors or sending messages.

Within finalisers uses the data field of the top body node and any TK_CALL
nodes as ast_send flags.
