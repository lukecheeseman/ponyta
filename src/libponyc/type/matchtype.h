 * Determine if we can match on operand_type and extract a pattern_type.
 *
 * Return ACCEPT if there exists a type which is all of:
 * 1. A subtype of operand_type.
 * 2. A type that an object of type operand_type can be safely used as. This is
 *    an important restriction to maintain capability safety. If operand_type
 *    is "Foo box" then "Foo ref" is a subtype of that, but not one that we can
 *    safely use.
 *    This complication exists because capabilities cannot be recovered at
 *    runtime and must be handled entirely at compile time.
 * 3. A subtype of pattern_type.
 *
 * Return DENY if no such type can exist, but one could if capabilities were
 * ignored. For example an operand_type of "Foo box" and a pattern_type of
 * "Foo ref". This is to prevent a match that could be detected with runtime
 * information but would actually violate the capability guarantees.
 * When DENY is returned, no matching is allowed, even if some other
 * is_matchtype() relationship exists.
 *
 * Return REJECT if no such type can exist.
